# sync-study
We are two college students who prefer company while studying. We thought it'd be cool to make an app to sync our study times so that we wouldn't have to constantly text each other about it.

We envision it to be like chat - where you see whether someone is online (when you can chat with them) or offline (when you can't). Except instead of online vs. offline, it's studying (and wanting company) vs. not studying. 
And instead of chatting, it's studying at the same time and at the same place (but possibly different subjects).

If you made it this far to the end of this rather verbose description, congratulations! Feel free to peruse the product of our pre-finals procrastination project.
